== Ottter

An app for the Ottawa area that determines your driving route to work and then texts you anytime there is a reported collision on one of the streets you use.

Collision reports are pulled from Twitter (using XML, not the API due to request limitations), alerts are scheduled via a Heroku scheduler rake task and delayed job, and texts are sent from a forked Nexmo wrapper (added a sleep param to better handle North American SMS throughput limitations)

Overall, this app (as it stands) probably violates the Google Maps TOS, maybe the Twitter TOS, and possible even Canadian copyright law (not sure if Tweets are copyrighted or not - seems to be a grey area). Nevertheless, it's useful to use and was great to build. 

Still not done, though, as tests are virtually non-existent (which is abhorent, I know - but I'm working on learning Test::Unit!)
